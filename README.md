## üîç What is Layered Code?

Traditional development with AI can feel chaotic - losing context, making large unfocused changes, or struggling to track what actually worked. **Layered Code** solves this by transforming how you build and evolve software through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This protocol enables AI assistants to maintain deep contextual awareness of your codebase while making focused, traceable changes.

## üí¨ How You Interact with Layered Code

**Layered Code** is designed to be used primarily through **conversational AI interfaces** that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Rather than memorizing complex commands or navigating intricate UIs, you simply describe what you want to build in natural language.

**Primary interaction method:**
- **üó£Ô∏è Natural language conversations** with AI assistants like Claude Desktop
- **üîå MCP integration** provides the AI with direct access to your codebase and layered history
- **üéØ Intent-driven development** - describe your goals, and the AI handles the technical implementation

**Example conversation:**
> "I want to redesign the homepage with a modern hero section, update the navigation menu, and add a testimonials carousel below the fold"

The AI, equipped with Layered Code's MCP tools, can:
- Understand your current page structure and styling
- Access the history of previous design layers and decisions
- Create a new layer with the homepage redesign
- Handle HTML structure changes, CSS updates, and asset organization
- Preserve your existing content while enhancing the visual design

While a CLI interface is available for direct tool access, the conversational AI experience through MCP is where **Layered Code** truly shines - enabling you to focus on what you want to build rather than how to build it.

## üéØ Motivation

**Layered Code** provides an open approach that gives you the freedom to choose your own tools, hosting providers, and development workflows: **Your code, your tools, your choice.**

- **üîì Forever Free & Open Source**: Layered Code will always remain completely free and open source
- **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Agnostic**: Works with any language, framework, or development environment
- **ü§ù Human-AI Partnership**: Designed for seamless collaboration between developers and AI agents
- **üìä Full Traceability**: Track feature evolution and maintain contextual awareness across your entire codebase
- **üöÄ Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Use any hosting provider, development environment, or toolchain

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

To build Layered Code from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/layered-flow/layered-code.git
cd layered-code

# Build with make (downloads ripgrep binaries automatically)
make build

# Or build for all platforms
make build-all

# Run tests
make test
```

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **No additional dependencies required** - ripgrep is automatically bundled with pre-built binaries and installed as a dependency via Homebrew
- **Git (optional)** - Required only if you want to use the git-related tools (git_status, git_diff, git_commit, etc.)

### Option 1: macOS/Linux via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew update
brew tap layered-flow/layered-code
brew install layered-code
```

Note: Homebrew will automatically install ripgrep as a dependency.

### Option 2: Install Script (macOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layered-flow/layered-code/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Note: This script downloads a self-contained binary with ripgrep bundled.

### Option 3: Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate archive for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/layered-flow/layered-code/releases). Each archive contains both the `layered-code` binary and a bundled `rg` (ripgrep) binary:

- **macOS (Intel)**: `layered-code_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `layered-code_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Linux (x86_64)**: `layered-code_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`
- **Linux (ARM64)**: `layered-code_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Windows (x86_64)**: `layered-code_Windows_x86_64.zip`
- **Windows (ARM64)**: `layered-code_Windows_arm64.zip` (uses x64 ripgrep binary via emulation)

**Setup steps:**

**macOS/Linux:**
1. Extract the archive: `tar -xzf layered-code_*.tar.gz`
2. Make both binaries executable: `chmod +x layered-code rg`
3. Move both binaries to the same directory:
   - For user installation: `mkdir -p ~/bin && mv layered-code rg ~/bin/`
   - For system-wide installation: `sudo mv layered-code rg /usr/local/bin/`
4. Ensure the location is in your PATH for easy access

**Windows:**
1. Extract the zip file (contains `layered-code.exe` and `rg.exe`)
2. Move both executables to the same convenient location (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\bin\`)
3. Add the directory to your PATH environment variable:
   - Open "Environment Variables" in System Properties
   - Add the directory containing both executables to your PATH

> **Important:** Keep both `layered-code` and `rg` (ripgrep) binaries in the same directory for proper functionality.

## ‚ú® Quick Start with Claude Desktop

While there are plans to support open source models through Ollama, Claude Desktop currently provides the best support for the Model Context Protocol that **Layered Code** relies on.

1. **Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)**

2. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings
   - Navigate to the "Developer" tab
   - Enable "Developer Mode" if not already enabled

3. **Install layered-code**: Follow the [Installation](#-installation) instructions above and note the path to your binary

4. **Configure MCP Server**:
   - Open Claude Desktop settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config
   - Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### Configure MCP Server in Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (under Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config), adjusting the `command` path as appropriate for your installation and platform:

| Platform/Install Method         | "command" value example                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| macOS/Linux (Homebrew)          | `layered-code`                                 |
| macOS/Linux (Manual/Binary)     | `/usr/local/bin/layered-code`                  |
| Windows                         | `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\bin\layered-code.exe`    |

> **Note for Windows:** Use the full path with double backslashes (`\\`) in the `"command"` value.

**Example configuration:**
```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "layered-code": {
      "command": "<see table above>",
      "args": ["mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (Windows may require you to "end task" on any Claude background tasks)
6. **Verify**: Check for "layered-code" in Claude's tools menu

### üîß Optional: Custom Apps Directory

By default, **Layered Code** uses `~/LayeredApps` as the directory for your applications. To use a custom directory:

**For MCP (Claude Desktop):** Add an `env` section to your configuration:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "layered-code": {
      "command": "layered-code",
      "args": ["mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY": "~/MyCustomAppsFolder"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For CLI usage:** Set the `LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY` environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY="~/MyCustomAppsFolder"
layered-code tool list_apps
```

### üîí Security

**Layered Code** maintains security when configuring custom app directories:

- For security, paths are validated to ensure they're within the user's home directory
- Relative paths are allowed and resolved relative to the user's home directory

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage

Use layered-code directly from the command line:

```bash
# Start MCP server
layered-code mcp_server

# List apps
layered-code tool list_apps

# Get version information
layered-code version
layered-code -v
layered-code --version

# Get help and usage information
layered-code help
layered-code -h
layered-code --help
```

**Available Commands:**
- `mcp_server` - Start the Model Context Protocol server for Claude Desktop integration
- `tool` - Run various tools and utilities (use with subcommands like below)
  
  **File Management Tools:**
