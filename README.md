*Watch a quick overview of Layered Code in action*

## üîç What is Layered Code?

**Layered Code** transforms web development into a seamless conversation-to-deployment workflow. You chat with your preferred AI assistant through applications like Claude Desktop or Cursor, describing what you want to build in natural language. The AI creates and modifies your code in real-time, while the Chrome extension automatically refreshes your browser to show changes instantly. When you're satisfied with the results, just ask the AI to commit your changes to a git repository and deploy directly to production servers ‚Äî all without memorizing complex commands or navigating intricate development tools.

**Primary interaction method:**
- **üó£Ô∏è Natural language conversations** with AI assistants like Claude Desktop
- **üîå MCP integration** provides the AI with direct access to your project files on your local machine
- **üéØ Intent-driven development** - describe your goals, and the AI handles the technical implementation
- **üöÄ Git integration for automatic deployments** - commit changes and deploy to production through conversational commands

**Example conversation:**
> **User:** "I want to create a basic web page with a dark theme to describe my new AI project called 'SmartFlow'. It should have a clean hero section with the project name, a brief description, and some key features listed below."

The AI, equipped with Layered Code's MCP tools, can:
- Create the HTML structure with semantic markup
- Generate CSS for a modern dark theme with proper contrast
- Organize project files and assets automatically
- Set up responsive design for mobile and desktop

> **User:** "This looks great! Can you add a contact section at the bottom and make the feature cards have a subtle hover effect?"

The AI seamlessly:
- Updates the HTML to include a contact section
- Enhances the CSS with smooth hover animations
- Your Chrome extension automatically refreshes to show the changes

> **User:** "Perfect! Now commit these changes and deploy to production."

The AI handles version control and deployment:
- Commits changes with a descriptive message
- Triggers your configured deployment pipeline
- Confirms successful deployment to your production server

While a CLI interface is available for direct tool access, the conversational AI experience through MCP is where **Layered Code** truly shines - enabling you to focus on what you want to build rather than how to build it.

## üéØ Motivation

**Layered Code** provides an open approach to AI-assisted development: **your prompts, your providers, your choice.**

- **üîì Forever Free & Open Source**: Layered Code will always remain free and open source
- **üíª Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **üîç No Hidden Magic**: No secret prompts hidden away from users doing mysterious things they don't understand
- **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Agnostic**: Works with any language, framework, or development environment
- **üöÄ Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Use any hosting provider, development environment, or toolchain

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: macOS/Linux via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew update
brew tap layered-flow/layered-code
brew install layered-code
```

### Option 2: Install Script (macOS/Linux)

For system-wide installation (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layered-flow/layered-code/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This installs the binaries to `/usr/local/bin` for easy access from anywhere.

If you prefer to install in the current directory instead, omit sudo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layered-flow/layered-code/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Note: This script downloads a self-contained binary with ripgrep bundled.

### Option 3: Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate archive for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/layered-flow/layered-code/releases). Each archive contains both the `layered-code` binary and a bundled `rg` (ripgrep) binary:

- **macOS (Intel)**: `layered-code_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `layered-code_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Linux (x86_64)**: `layered-code_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`
- **Linux (ARM64)**: `layered-code_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Windows (x86_64)**: `layered-code_Windows_x86_64.zip`
- **Windows (ARM64)**: `layered-code_Windows_arm64.zip` (uses x64 ripgrep binary via emulation)

**Setup steps:**

**macOS/Linux:**
1. Extract the archive: `tar -xzf layered-code_*.tar.gz`
2. Make both binaries executable: `chmod +x layered-code rg`
3. Move both binaries to the same directory:
   - For user installation: `mkdir -p ~/bin && mv layered-code rg ~/bin/`
   - For system-wide installation: `sudo mv layered-code rg /usr/local/bin/`
4. Ensure the location is in your PATH for easy access

**Windows:**
1. Extract the zip file (contains `layered-code.exe` and `rg.exe`)
2. Move both executables to the same convenient location (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\bin\`)
3. Add the directory to your PATH environment variable:
   - Open "Environment Variables" in System Properties
   - Add the directory containing both executables to your PATH

> **Important:** Keep both `layered-code` and `rg` (ripgrep) binaries in the same directory for proper functionality.

## ‚ú® Quick Start with Claude Desktop

While there are plans to support open source models through Ollama, Claude Desktop currently provides the best support for the Model Context Protocol that **Layered Code** relies on.

1. **Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)**

2. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings
   - Navigate to the "Developer" tab
   - Enable "Developer Mode" if not already enabled

3. **Install layered-code**: Follow the [Installation](#-installation) instructions above and note the path to your binary

4. **Configure MCP Server**:
   - Open Claude Desktop settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config
   - Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### Configure MCP Server in Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (under Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config), adjusting the `command` path as appropriate for your installation and platform:

| Platform/Install Method         | "command" value example                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| macOS/Linux (Homebrew)          | `layered-code`                                 |
| macOS/Linux (Manual/Binary)     | `/usr/local/bin/layered-code`                  |
| Windows                         | `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\bin\\layered-code.exe`    |

> **Note for Windows:** Use the full path with double backslashes (`\\`) in the `"command"` value.

**Example configuration:**
```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "layered-code": {
      "command": "<see table above>",
      "args": ["mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (Windows may require you to "end task" on any Claude background tasks)
6. **Verify**: Check for "layered-code" in Claude's tools menu

### üåê Chrome Extension for Live Preview

The Layered Code Chrome extension enables real-time previewing of changes made through MCP. When you edit files through Claude Desktop, the extension automatically refreshes your browser to show the changes instantly.

**Installation Options:**

#### Option 1: Chrome Web Store (Recommended)
Install directly from the Chrome Web Store:
[https://chrome.layeredcode.ai/](https://chrome.layeredcode.ai/)

#### Option 2: Developer Mode
1. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner

2. **Load the Extension**:
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to the `chrome-extension` folder in your layered-code directory
   - Select the folder and click "Select"

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - You should see "Layered Code Live Preview" in your extensions list
   - The extension icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar

**Usage:**
- Open your HTML file directly in Chrome (e.g., `file:///Users/yourname/LayeredApps/myproject/index.html`)
- The extension will automatically detect file changes made through MCP via a websocket
- Your browser will refresh instantly when changes are saved

### üîß Optional: Custom Apps Directory

By default, **Layered Code** uses `~/LayeredApps` as the directory for your applications. To use a custom directory:

**For MCP (Claude Desktop):** Add an `env` section to your configuration:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "layered-code": {
      "command": "layered-code",
      "args": ["mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY": "~/MyCustomAppsFolder"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For CLI usage:** Set the `LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY` environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export LAYERED_APPS_DIRECTORY="~/MyCustomAppsFolder"
layered-code tool list_apps
```

### üîí Security

**Layered Code** maintains security when configuring custom app directories:

- For security, paths are validated to ensure they're within the user's home directory
- Relative paths are allowed and resolved relative to the user's home directory

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage
